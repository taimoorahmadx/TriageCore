# Progress

Agent memory across sessions. Read this first in every session. Keep it under ~80 lines:
**replace** the "Now" section each session; append to "Lessons" only when something cost time;
move resolved blockers out. Task status and what's next: `TODO.md` only.
History lives in git and `docs/log/ai-usage-log.md`.

## Now
- C11 is complete: the CI Engine tab runs fixture cases and shows the masked log excerpt, extracted
  facts, commit attribution (including ambiguous candidates), posterior, expected losses, decision,
  and true label. The API response includes a bounded excerpt and explicit trace status. Frontend lint
  and production build passed; the browser check rendered both `dependency_failure` and
  `hosted_runner_timeout` with all evidence sections. No C11 blockers remain.

## Blockers / questions for the team
- Supervisor sign-off on the method change (X1 hard block, CI pre-rerun evidence) before FYP-1 Final.
- Team review of `docs/spec.md` and `docs/plan.md` (AI-drafted; must be owned).
- Each member completes their rows in `docs/disclosure.md` §2.
- End-of-FYP-1 C3 needs a suitable dataset or enough real cases with evidence for every cause. The current
  61-folder working corpus must be pruned before completion; C3 still requires 30–40 reviewed cases
  with at least five per cause. This does not block the current implementation branch.
- C12 requires reviewed labels and enough cases for a
  training/holdout split disjoint from C10 benchmark cases; agents must not invent labels or claim
  results before evaluation.

## Decisions (short; full record in docs/plan.md §7 and docs/adr/)
- D1 offline CI slice for FYP-1 · D2 heal suggests a patch, never writes · D3 `rerun` added ·
  D4 expected-state marker supplied by the test author · D5 no LangGraph · D6 SQLite · D7 one `flaky` label, per-source meaning.

## Lessons (gotchas that cost time)
- `make lint` reports 5 pre-existing findings in `src/core/models.py` (A6, 2026-10-25).
- Chromium logs "Failed to load resource" for every failed request; it is excluded from
  `console_errors` so one 404 is not counted twice.
- Tailwind v4: `frontend/src/index.css` must keep `@config "../tailwind.config.js";` or the UI is unstyled.
- Pages in `tests/dummy/` are duplicated in `frontend/public/`; edit both and `diff`.
- Port 8000 busy: `fuser -k 8000/tcp`.
- Without `GROQ_API_KEY`, every renamed step escalates (fail-safe), which is expected, not a bug.
- Playwright sync API needs plain `def` FastAPI handlers (worker thread), not `async def`.
- FastAPI 0.162: `app.routes` holds `_IncludedRouter` objects without `.path`. List routes with
  `app.openapi()["paths"]` plus `getattr(r, "path", None)` for mounts.
